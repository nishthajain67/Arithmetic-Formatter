# Arithmetic Formatter 🧮

A Python program that formats arithmetic problems vertically, making them easier to read and solve - just like how we write math problems on paper!

## About This Project

This project was completed as part of freeCodeCamp's **Scientific Computing with Python** certification. It demonstrates my understanding of Python fundamentals including string manipulation, list operations, and error handling.

## What It Does

The program takes a list of arithmetic problems and arranges them vertically, side by side:

**Input:**
```python
["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"]
```

**Output:**
```
   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    + 49
-----    ------    ----    ----
```

## Features

✨ Supports addition and subtraction  
✨ Formats up to 5 problems at once  
✨ Proper spacing and alignment  
✨ Optional answer display  
✨ Error handling for invalid inputs  

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- String manipulation
- List operations
- Error handling

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Problem-solving:** Breaking down complex formatting requirements
- **String Operations:** Using `.rjust()`, `.split()`, and string formatting
- **Error Handling:** Validating user inputs
- **Code Organization:** Writing clean, readable functions
